WARNING:
restas-odesk works only with the latest version (check master branch) of restas which
only works with the latest hunchentoot.

To run restas-odesk do:

> (load "restas-odesk.asd")
> (require :restas-odesk)
> (restas:define-module #:test (:use #:cl))
> (in-package #:test)
> (restas:mount-submodule test-restas-odesk (#:restas.odesk)
     (restas.odesk:*odesk-api-public-key* "PK")
     (restas.odesk:*odesk-api-secret-key* "SK"))
> (restas:start '#:test :port 8000)

Don't forget to put real public-key and secret-key instead of "PK" and "SK".
You have to add keys at odesk api center: http://www.odesk.com/services/api/keys
